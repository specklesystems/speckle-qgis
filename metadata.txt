about=
    The Speckle QGIS plugin allows you send and receive data from multiple sources to/from several layers in your project, and store their geometry (as well as their contained metadata), in a Speckle server. 
    
    Don't know what Speckle is? You're not alone! Find out more at https://speckle.systems
    You can start exploring by checking out this commit generated in QGIS from open web data sources (OSM, Google Satellite Tiles and Mapzen Terrain Tiles): https://app.speckle.systems/projects/5feae56049/models/1a95ec93ec 
    
    Requirements:
    - Speckle Manager: You can download the installer here -> https://speckle.guide/user/manager
    - An account in a Speckle server. If you don't have one, feel free to use our public server https://app.speckle.systems/
    - An account added in the Accounts section of the Speckle Manager
    - Windows and Mac compatible
    
    If the requirements are not fullfilled, the plugin will load but will not have any functionality enabled.
    
    If you're having issues with this plugin, you can always reach us at https://speckle.community

    Plugin is using the external libraries such as pyshp, scipy, triangle and specklepy, which will be installed automatically to a custom folder.
    
    Data types currently not supported for sending:
    - Layers depending on the server connection (WMS, WFC, WCS etc.) 
    - Scenes 
    - Mesh Vector layers 
    - Pointclouds
