about=
    The Speckle QGIS plugin allows you send and receive data from multiple sources to/from several layers in your project, and store their geometry (as well as their contained metadata), in a Speckle server. 
    
    Don't know what Speckle is? You're not alone! Find out more at https://speckle.systems
    
    Requirements:
    - Speckle Manager: You can download the installer here -> https://speckle.guide/user/manager
    - An account in a Speckle server. If you don't have one, feel free to use our public server https://speckle.xyz
    - An account added in the Accounts section of the Speckle Manager
    - Windows and Mac compatible
    
    If the requirements are not fullfilled, the plugin will load but will not have any functionality enabled.
